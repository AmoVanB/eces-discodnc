# DiscoDNC

Deterministic Network Calculus (DNC) is a methodology for worst-case modeling and analysis of communication networks. It enables to derive deterministic bounds on a server’s backlog as well as a flow’s end-to-end delay. Given a directed graph of servers (server graph) and the flows crossing these servers, the Disco Deterministic Network Calculator (DiscoDNC) automates the derivation of bounds.

# LKN Fork

This is a fork of the 2.4.3 version of the [Disco DNC project (now networkcalculus.org DNC project)]( https://github.com/NetCal/DNC).
A few minor modifications have been made in order to match the needs of our [*deterministic network modeling* (DNM)](https://github.com/AmoVanB/eces-dnm) module.
A comprehensive list of the changes can be found in the `Changelog.txt` file.
