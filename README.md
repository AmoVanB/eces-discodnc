# DiscoDNC

Deterministic Network Calculus (DNC) is a methodology for worst-case modeling and analysis of communication networks. It enables to derive deterministic bounds on a server’s backlog as well as a flow’s end-to-end delay. Given a directed graph of servers (server graph) and the flows crossing these servers, the Disco Deterministic Network Calculator (DiscoDNC) automates the derivation of bounds.
